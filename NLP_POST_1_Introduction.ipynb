        "NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. As the name itself suggests that, the goal of this new domain is to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of Natural Language data. Yes, your thinking is correct, here natural language means the language that we, humans, use to interact. This is another approach to improve human computer interaction. It allows machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that feels more natural to us. Loosely speaking, we want to achieve that the day will come when a computer will talk with a human like we talk with our friends nowadays.  \n",

        "In ML approach text is converted to numbers by one hot encoding for example { rat = [0 0 1 0 ............0], mat = [0 0 0 1 ..............0] etc.}. But this method has two significant drawbacks. One is that the size of the vector will be the number of words in the dictionary and this number is huge. Another, issue is that, as you can observe the vectors written above are orthogonal. There is no natural notion of similarity between those one hot vectors. (How to address this problem? I will discuss this idea in the upcoming post.) So, sequential information of a sentence is lost. So, deep learning is needed."

## Why do we need RNN?  
Ans: ANN can't capture sequential information. The problem with sequential data like text is that each sentence has a different length i.e. some sentence has 5 words, some other sentence may have 7 words. So how do you design a Neural Network where the oinput layer can take input of different lengths. To address these issues an architectural change was needed. That architectural change came in the form of a RNN(Recurrent Neural Network).
